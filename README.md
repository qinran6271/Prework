Submitted by: Qinran Wang

Time spent: 4hrs
## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] add "per person cost" to count the money of each person should pay.
- [x] Implement dark mode on the setting page

## Notes

In this project, I add "per person cost" to count the money of each person should pay. In try to use Userdefault to connect setting page and main page, but I faild. But I use it successfully to add "per person cost".
I can only change to Dark model in setting page. But I can not change whole application. That why I did not show how my setting page connect with my main page.
